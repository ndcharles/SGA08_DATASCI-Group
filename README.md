## Introduction 
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a company’s customers into groups that reflect similarity among customers in each group. The goal of segmenting customers is to decide how to relate to customers in each segment in order to maximize the value of each customer to the business.

The purpose of this project is to understand the customers who can easily converge (Target Customers) in Mr Ken’s supermarket so that the sense can be given to the marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly. This is an unsupervised learning problem hence we used Kmeans clustering to segment the customers and provide Mr Ken with the Target Customers.
